                    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a

                        son
                        and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
                        far
                        beyond the world of known physics.

                    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have
                        made the universe bang to begin
                        with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
                        itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                        faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                        <br>
                        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole
                        to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
                        wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                        detection, like spit in the ocean.
                        <br>
                        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box
                        around it.
                        <br>
                        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
                        beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                        right.
                        <br>
                        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at
                        the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
                        Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the
                        signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
                        trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
                        inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

                    THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can
                    observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we
                    look, the universe has an even temperature</p>

                <p>NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
                    side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot
                    and cold to mix into an even temperature.</p>

                <p>DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see
                    a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has
                    cooled. </p>

                    cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every
                    direction, you might want to look for another explanation.</p>

                <p>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before
                    they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the
                    same time, that might explain their even temperature.</p>

                <p>INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the
                    Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently
                    expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>

                <p>FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of
                    polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early
                    universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein</p>

                <p>EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and
                    cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of
                    the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only
                        one in 10 million.
                        <br>
                        Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite
                        confirmation in his lifetime.
                        <br>
                        “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
                        <br>
                        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and
                        analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work
                        to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
                        Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.
                        <br>
                        “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac,
                        who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.
                        <br>
                        Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of
                        inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean
                        last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on
                        his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.

                        “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not

                        Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating.
                        “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.

                        By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                        spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
                        <br>
                        Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it
                        will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
                        <br>
                        John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
                        project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the
                        results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
                        <br>
                        Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a
                        pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate
                        his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
                        <br>
                        Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting
                        that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic
                        background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the
                        universe.
                        <br>
                        “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
                        <br>
                        Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings
                        this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons,
                        mountaintops and space.
                        <br>
                        Spirals in the Sky
                        <br>
                        Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which
                        were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago.They
                        won the Nobel Prize.
                        <br>
                        Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four
                        leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the
                        South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement
                        Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and
                        Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
                        <br>
                        “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said.
                        He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
                        said.

                    <p>We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation
                        erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are
                        swept away, forever out of our view.
                        <br>
                        “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was
                        not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
